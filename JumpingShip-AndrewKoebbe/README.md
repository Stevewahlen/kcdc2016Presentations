# Jumping Ship: A Holistic Approach to Switching Jobs
## Andrew Koebbe

There comes a point in every career when it's time to move on and take the next step with another employer. Even if that day isn't today you need to have a plan and calculate the numbers to determine when it's time to jump ship and which ship to climb aboard next.

We'll talk about building connections and support, litmus tests for evaluating potential jobs, a framework for handling job offers, and a plan to jump ship in which your former colleagues will cheer you on.
