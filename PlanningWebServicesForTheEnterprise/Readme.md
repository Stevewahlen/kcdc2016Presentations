## Planning Web Services for the Enterprise

## Abstract

Designing a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) or API is just the first step in delivering an enterprise service platform. How will these services be reused? How will developers gain access to them? What kind of approval process is required for them to get access? How will performance be monitored? This session will show how Application Services Governance provides the tools to deliver agility, cost efficiency, risk management and stability to your consumers.
