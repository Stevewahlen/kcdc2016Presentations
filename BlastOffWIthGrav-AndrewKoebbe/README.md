# Blast Off with Grav, The Dynamic Flat File CMS
## Andrew Koebbe

There are many great CMSs out there. Database-backed CMSs provide a nice admin interface, and static file generators have great performance and content deployment strategies. But both of these approaches have their downsides and there is another option with the best of both worlds.

In this session we'll check out Grav, a dynamic flat file CMS with an impressive optional admin UI and great performance. We'll walk through basic set up, content creation, custom content types and more with only Markdown, YAML, and Twig.
