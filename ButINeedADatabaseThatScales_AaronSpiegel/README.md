# But I Need a Database that _Scales_
#### or "Evaluating polyglot persistence options"

### Aaron Spiegel

For about 20 years, the relational database reigned supreme for database-management systems. For 5 years, NoSQL databases have encroached on that territory by breaking rules and making different underlying assumptions. Misreading and misunderstanding of these assumptions can be more than inconvenient-- it's been the nail in the coffin for projects and startups.

In this talk, we'll review common scaling techniques for both relational and NoSQL databases. We'll discuss real-world trade-offs of these techniques and their effect on query flexibility, transactions and consistency. Then we'll demonstrate how we can create an evaluation process for any persistence strategy, starting with some popular examples. Attendees will be able to apply this knowledge as a systematic approach to evaluate existing technologies, or new ones as they come out.
